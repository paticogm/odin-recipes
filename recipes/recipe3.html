            Smoothies are a great way to increase your daily servings of fruits and vegetables. One of the healthiest ways to enjoy a smoothie is to make your own to ensure you're getting enough servings of fruits and vegetables. A healthy smoothie should include protein and fiber to help keep you full and provide antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. For our fruit & yogurt smoothie recipe, you can use any combination of frozen fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, pineapple or peaches.
